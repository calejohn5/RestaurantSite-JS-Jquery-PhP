# RestaurantSite-JS-Jquery-PhP

This is a website I completed in College.  It was built using Bootstrap 4, PhP, JavaScript, mySQL, and Jquery.

# Jquery used for
* fading images in/out in carousel home page.
* giving special effects to modals.
* allows accordion to de/collapse with buttons.
* create popup notifying user.
* used alongside an XML file to fill recipes page with data/images.
* collapsing navigation bar.

# JavaScript used for
* pulling data from PhP array to fill the accordion on menu page.
* validating password requirements.
* calculating how many points away from free food.

# PhP used for
* all communications with mySQL database.
* allows all users to register and stores their info in database.
* reporting all errors related to creating/logging in account.
* most validation.
* creating arrays for menu items.
* pull info from database showing most profile item details.

## XML used to store recipe item data.
## HTML/CSS used to make things default header/footer and make everything pretty.
## mySQL used with Apache through XAMPP.
